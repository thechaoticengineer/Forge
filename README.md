# Forge

A minimal wrapper around AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI) for
building software — including Forge itself — with almost no ceremony.

Rust engine + Quickshell (Omarchy) panel.

## The loop

1. Point Forge at a git repository and describe a goal.
2. A planner agent (Claude Code or Codex) writes a staged plan to
   `.forge/plan.json` — each stage has instructions, acceptance criteria,
   and a proposed commit message.
3. You mark the plan OK in the panel.
4. Forge runs each stage automatically:
   - the **implementer** (one tool) implements the stage,
   - an independent **reviewer** (the other tool, always a fresh session)
     reviews the uncommitted diff and writes `.forge/verdict.json`,
   - rejections loop back to the implementer with the reviewer's issues,
     up to a bounded number of fix rounds,
   - an approved stage is committed with the proposed message.
5. After the last stage, Forge pushes to `origin`.

The reviewer's verdict has the shape
`{"approved": bool, "summary": str, "issues": [str, ...]}`.
The summary describes what the reviewer inspected and found, even on
approval; issues are specific, actionable feedback for the implementer.
Every review round is recorded in the stage's `reviews` array in
`.forge/plan.json`, with `round` (starting at 1), `approved`, `summary`,
`issues`, and `unix` (a Unix timestamp in seconds). Earlier feedback stays
available through fix rounds and approval.

If the reviewer still rejects after the fix rounds, the stage is marked
blocked and Forge stops for you. Full history of every agent session,
verdict, and git action is visible in the panel and kept in
`.forge/history.jsonl`. Review approval events include the reviewer's
summary, limited to 300 characters; the stage's `reviews` array keeps
the full summary.

### Editing the plan

After the planner writes a draft, use **Edit plan** in the panel to repair
it by hand: edit each stage's title, instructions, acceptance criteria,
and proposed commit message, or add, remove, and reorder stages. Committed
stages are locked. Click **Save** to keep your changes or **Cancel** to
discard them.

To ask AI for changes, type feedback into the field beside **Improve with
AI**, then click the button or press `Enter`. Forge re-runs the planner
against the current plan and your feedback, keeping the same overall goal.
A failed AI revision keeps the previous plan.

Saving manual edits or completing an AI revision produces a new draft that
needs your approval again before running. Both paths preserve committed
stages. You can also edit or revise an approved or completed plan while
Forge is idle and the queue is inactive.

The JSON API accepts POST requests to `/api/plan/edit` with
`{"plan":{"goal":"…","stages":[{"id":1,"title":"…","instructions":"…","acceptance":"…","commit":"…"}]}}`
and `/api/plan/revise` with `{"feedback":"…"}`. For manual edits, submit the
complete stage list, keeping committed stages at the start in their original
order; omit `id` for new stages to have Forge assign one. AI feedback must
not be blank. Both endpoints require an existing plan and reject requests
while the project is busy or its queue is active.

## Queue

Add multiple goals from the panel's queue section, reorder them, then
start the queue. Forge processes one goal at a time through the same
plan → approve → run loop above.

The `queue_auto_approve` setting is off by default: Forge pauses at each
plan for your usual approval. Enable it to approve each plan automatically
and run the queue unattended. A blocked or failed item stops the queue
for human intervention; remaining goals stay queued.

Queue state lives in `.forge/queue.json` in the project. The panel shows
each item's status; the bar widget shows the pending count and a queue tooltip.

The JSON API accepts POST requests to `/api/queue/add` with `{"goal":"…"}`,
`/api/queue/remove` with `{"id":1}`, and `/api/queue/move` with
`{"id":1,"dir":"up"}` (or `"down"`). `/api/queue/clear` removes pending
goals; `/api/queue/start` starts processing. `GET /api/state` includes
the queue and whether it is active.

## Run

```
cargo run [/path/to/project]
```

The engine serves a JSON API on `http://127.0.0.1:8734` for the panel
(also usable with `curl`). Requires `claude` and/or `codex` CLIs on
PATH, logged in.

The Omarchy plugin (`manifest.json`, `quickshell/`) provides the bar
widget and the Forge panel: pick planner/implementer/reviewer, set the
project path, type the goal, create the plan, approve, start.
Each reviewed stage has a review chip showing approval or the latest issue
count, plus the number of rounds when there is more than one. Expand a
stage to see its full per-round review history: approved or rejected,
the reviewer's summary, and issues, including reviews after fix rounds.

### Updating and troubleshooting

Run `./install.sh` to install the current working tree. The panel's **Update
Forge** button posts to `/api/self_update`, which runs the same script in a
transient `forge-update` systemd user unit so it survives the engine restart.
The script builds the release binary, validates the plugin, and restarts
`forge-engine.service`. For an existing plugin with an unchanged manifest,
changed plugin files are replaced in place one file at a time via atomic rename
so the running shell hot-reloads them. Unchanged files stay in place. Only a
brand-new plugin or a manifest change triggers `omarchy restart shell`, after
a short delay to let hot reload settle.

If an update misbehaves, check the update log, engine log, and shell crashes:

```sh
journalctl --user -u forge-update
journalctl --user -u forge-engine
coredumpctl list /usr/bin/quickshell
```

If the panel does not reflect an installed update, compare the shell start time
from `ps -o lstart= -p $(pgrep -x quickshell)` with the update time in
`journalctl --user -u forge-update`. If the shell predates the update, run
`omarchy restart shell` manually to recover from a stale shell.

The 2026-09-06 crash came from an in-place plugin copy racing a shell restart.
The directory swap introduced afterward broke watcher-based hot reload; per-file
atomic rename now replaces that swap for ordinary plugin updates, which do not
restart the shell.

### Keyboard

The panel uses vim-inspired normal and insert modes. In normal mode, `i`
focuses the goal for typing; clicking a text field also enters insert mode.
`Escape` leaves the field, or closes the top overlay when already in normal mode.

Open keyboard help with the `? Help` button in the panel header or by clicking the
mode hint at the bottom of the panel, which says "click here or press ? (Shift+/)
or F1 for keyboard help" and underlines on hover.

Actions follow the buttons’ enabled state. Uppercase keys use `Shift`.
